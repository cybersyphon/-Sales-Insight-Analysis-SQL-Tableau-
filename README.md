# Description
In this project, I performed comprehensive data analysis to gain insights into sales trends. I began by creating an Aims Grid to outline the project's purpose, stakeholders, end results, and success criteria. Using SQL, I executed a series of queries to extract data from customer and transaction databases. These queries included displaying all customer records, determining the total number of customers, analyzing transactions in the Chennai market, extracting distinct product codes sold in Chennai, filtering transactions in US dollars, and more. Particularly, I focused on transactions from the year 2020, where I joined data with a date table to analyze annual revenue, including a detailed breakdown for January and specific insights into the Chennai market.

Following the data extraction and transformation process, I utilized Tableau to create a dynamic and interactive dashboard. This dashboard displayed key metrics such as Revenue Trend, Sales in North Zone, Top Customers and their Order Quantities, Profit Margin by City, Quarterly Revenue Trend, and Revenue by Top 5 Customers.
